Description: Power and sample size are calculated for tests that compare two multivariate mean vectors.
	Included tests are Hotelling's T2 test (multivariate F test), O'Briens OLS test (using the sum of individual test statistics) 
	and the maximum t test (using the maximum of individual test statistics). Functions to simulate estimates from multivariate 
	data and to perform the tests are included, such that the calculations can be checked by simulation.
